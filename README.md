# ATM Waveform Tools
This collection of MATLABÂ® functions is for working with ATM (Airborne Topographic Mapper, https://atm.wff.nasa.gov/) laser altimetry data products in HDF5 waveform format. 

The data products (designated ILATMW1B) are freely available at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC)
at https://nsidc.org/data/icebridge or can be downloaded from the NASA Earthdata portal at https://earthdata.nasa.gov/

The ILATMW1B waveform data is available at NSIDC:
https://nsidc.org/data/ILNSAW1B/versions/1 (narrow swath)
https://nsidc.org/data/ILATMW1B/versions/1 (wide swath)

A user guide for the ILATMW1B waveform data is included and can also be downloaded here:
